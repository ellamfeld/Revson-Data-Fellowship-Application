    <h1>Hi, I'm Ella Feldman.</h1>

    <h3>And I'm applying to the Revson Data Fellowship.</h3>

    <img src="Ella.jpeg">

    <h5> ^^^That's me in Buenos Aires, where I lived for 15 months before starting at CUNY. </h5>

    <p>I'm a first-semester student at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY, where I study Economics Reporting and Data Journalism. I'm also interested in audio journalism and feature writing.</p>

    <p>Before this fall, my only HTML experience was fiddling with my middle school Tumblr blog so that it would rain snowflakes and play a Vampire Weekend song upon loading. Over the last three months, I've developed a major interest in website coding, dataset analysis and data visualization. I'm excited to continue to sharpen my data reporting skills over my remaining year at Newmark and throughout my career. It would be an honor to do so as a Revson Data Fellow.</p>

    <p>Below is my application for the fellowship, along with clip links. Thank you for your consideration!</p>

    <h3>1. Tell us a little bit about yourself, your commitment to data journalism — and where and how the two intersect.</h3>

    <p>While designing my fall schedule, I stared at Introduction to Data Journalism with a little dread. As an early-career journalist who majored in gender studies and is generally inclined toward longer-form narrative feature reporting, I have long considered myself to be “not a STEM person.”</p>

    <p>It’s not very characteristic for me to place myself in a box. Throughout my career, I rarely have. My experience is varied: I’ve produced audio at Houston’s NPR station, managed social media at the Austin American-Statesman and edited Washington City Paper’s things-to-do section.</p>

    <p>Of all the internships, jobs and freelance gigs I’ve held, my favorites have been the ones where I pitched and reported my own stories — though I don’t put myself in a box as a reporter, either. I’ve covered <a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2018/09/14/304061/victim-of-alleged-abuse-by-conroe-priest-is-disappointed-in-cardinal-dinardos-response/" style="color: #ea7000;"; target="_blank">systemic abuse</a> in the Catholic Church for News 88.7, <a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2021/07/06/some-texas-students-want-more-not-fewer-lessons-race-and-racism/7854984002/" style="color: #ea7000;"; target="_blank">efforts to limit how race is taught in schools</a> for the Austin American-Statesman, the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/nazis-stole-two-egon-schiele-paintings-from-a-jewish-cabaret-star-now-his-descendants-are-auctioning-them-to-help-underrepresented-artists-180980995/" style="color: #ea7000;"; target="_blank">restitution of Nazi-looted paintings</a> for Smithsonian Magazine, <a href="https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/746971/looking-for-a-good-dance-party-try-the-loading-dock/" style="color: #ea7000;"; target="_blank">D.C.’s underground dance party culture</a> for Washington City Paper and <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/as-inflation-skyrockets-argentina-must-choose-outsider-or-status-quo-for-president/" style="color: #ea7000;"; target="_blank">Argentina’s 2023 election of President Javier Milei</a> for Courthouse News Service.</p>

    <p>The thread that weaves my portfolio together is my ability to ground facts and newsworthy information in compelling storytelling. As a journalist, I aim to deliver captivating stories based on thorough reporting, meticulous fact-checking and a commitment to covering topics that go under-reported.</p>

    <p>On my first day of Introduction to Data Journalism, I had only a vague understanding of what data journalism is, accompanied by a bit of intimidation. Today, I see it as one of the most effective tools I can use to do what I want to spend my life doing: Reporting gripping, impactful stories that shed light on under-reported topics and hold power to account.</p>

    <p>My data journalism experience is nascent, but it has left me wanting more. For a recent data reporting assignment, I created an arrow chart to explore <a href="https://ellamfeld.github.io/Data-Assignment-2/" style="color: #ea7000;"; target="_blank">New York’s shift towards Donald Trump</a>. I found it invigorating to dive into polling numbers and attempt to visualize them in a fresh way.</p>

<iframe title="Where did Trump gain the greatest percentage of votes in New York State?" aria-label="Arrow Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-V8W9G" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/V8W9G/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="412" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

    <p>I then wanted to experiment with mapping, so I decided to supplement a story I wrote for a different class on <a href="https://ellamfeld.github.io/Bay-Ridge-Cannabis-Dispensary/" style="color: #ea7000;"; target="_blank">Bay Ridge’s soon-to-open first legal cannabis shop</a> with a map that illustrates how far the neighborhood's residents currently are from a dispensary. Once again, it was fulfilling to tinker with visualization and think creatively about how to enhance my story using data.</p>

    <iframe title="Adult-Use Cannabis Dispensaries in Brooklyn" aria-label="Locator map" id="datawrapper-chart-i9zie" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/i9zie/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="602" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

    <p>Data, to quote Newmark faculty, can be interviewed and scrutinized like any other source, a process that might result in information that is surprising, challenging and disruptive of expectations. That’s often the sort of information the public deserves to know. It’s also the sort of thing that makes for a great story.</p>

    <p>I came to Newmark with a commitment to diligent, meaningful reporting and great storytelling. I didn’t initially think that data journalism would be my route there, but I have found myself invigorated by the depth this new skill has brought to my reporting, and am eager to learn more.</p>

    <h3>2. Tell us how you could contribute to whatever newsroom you land an internship in this coming summer.</h3>

    <p>It’s one thing if I tell you how many cases of dengue fever Argentina recorded in a seven month period. It is another if I introduce you to a die-hard soccer fan living in Buenos Aires who had to miss a match between his team and their rival because the disease left him bedridden for days with body aches and a debilitating fever. When I pitched a story on the <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/latin-america-on-track-for-its-worst-dengue-fever-outbreak-in-history/" style="color: #ea7000;"; target="_blank">spread of dengue fever across Latin America</a> to Courthouse News Service, I did both.</p>

    <p>Readers of outlets like THE CITY and Chalkbeat want rigorously fact-checked information about the world around them. They also want voices they can connect to, and a reason to care. Whether I am reporting on dengue fever or on <a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2021/11/17/californians-moving-austin-droves-heres-what-they-say-why-housing-market-california-texas-transplant/8622293002/" style="color: #ea7000;"; target="_blank">Californians relocating to Austin</a>, I aim to deliver all of the above.</p>

    <p>If I am selected as a Revson Data Fellow, I would use my thorough pitching, reporting and writing experience as a launching pad for producing compelling local data journalism, building on the skills that I will learn in Data Journalism next semester, along with the business and economics reporting skills I will learn in Covering the Economy.</p>

    <p>I would also bring perspective. Being the daughter of an Argentine immigrant is an experience that constantly informs my work. Speaking native Spanish empowers me to pursue stories about the Latinx community, whether by reporting on Argentine politics or publishing an <a href="https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/604143/in-silent-tenants-alberto-roblest-gives-voice-to-d-cs-working-class-latinx-community/" style="color: #ea7000;"; target="_blank">interview with a Mexican poet</a> in both English and Spanish.</p>

    <p>Having been raised by an immigrant also inspires me to look for stories within other communities that have a history of being overlooked and oversimplified by journalists. During the summer of 2020, I profiled <a href="https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/1389/behind-the-movement/" style="color: #ea7000;"; target="_blank">organizers behind local Black Lives Matter protests</a> in a <a href="https://issuu.com/washcp/docs/wascp081420" style="color: #ea7000;"; target="_blank">cover story</a> for Washington City Paper. I have interviewed students numerous times, whether about efforts to limit how race is taught in Texas schools or a <a href="https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/504076/wilson-high-schools-student-newspaper-endorses-edna-b-jackson-for-schools-new-name/" style="color: #ea7000;"; target="_blank">controversial effort to rename a high school</a>. As a queer woman, co-authoring an extensive <a href="https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/740042/d-c-s-gay-bars-an-oral-history/" style="color: #ea7000;"; target="_blank">history of D.C.’s gay bars</a> was a career highlight.</p>

    <p>Throughout my entire career, I have covered under-represented stories and perspectives with a curious, empathetic and informed approach. I would bring those same reporting values to THE CITY, Chalkbeat or other local outlet.</p>

    <p>If selected, I am especially eager to contribute data journalism about containerization efforts, migration and the economy under the Trump administration, and the occasional arts and culture story.</p>
